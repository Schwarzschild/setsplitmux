The setsplitmux project should be located in ~/dev/setsplitmux

The program should be run like this:

  $ setsplitmux.zsh <config file name>

An example:

  $ setsplitmux.zsh "2-shot C&D.xml"

That xml config file was created and then export with SplitMux.

It may be saved on your computer in Dropbox/LIVESTREAMING/TechnicalFiles/

The location of those config files, the Splitmux username and password,
and the IP address for the SplitMux appliance are all set in the setsplitmux.zsh file.

You can change those settings with a text editor by changing them in setsplitmux.zsh.
